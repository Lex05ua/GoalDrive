# 🚗 GoalDrive Tracker Bot

**GoalDrive** is a Telegram bot designed to help users (especially aspiring IT professionals) visualize their financial goals, track savings for a car, and calculate the actual "work effort" required to reach the target.

## 🌟 Why this project?
I created this tool to solve a personal challenge: staying motivated while saving for a car. It bridges the gap between raw numbers and the real effort needed, converting car prices into work hours based on target IT salaries.

- **Progress Tracking:** Add savings and see your progress percentage in real-time.
- **Effort Calculation:** Automatically calculates how many work hours/days are left based on your hourly rate.
- **English Interface:** Built for the international/EU market.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Framework:** [Aiogram 3.x](https://docs.aiogram.dev/) (Asynchronous Telegram Bot API)
- **Concepts used:** Separation of concerns (Logic vs Interface), Environment variables, Asynchronous programming.
